# Spellcraft

Spellcraft is an Arcana sigil for designing, installing, validating, observing, and revising spells.

It helps users combine existing sigils into localized workflows without copying or mutating the sigils themselves. A spell defines orchestration: phases, shared state, gates, handoffs, failure policy, local customization, and observability.

Spellcraft also manages spell aliases. A spell keeps a stable canonical ID for filenames and automation, while users can invoke it through memorable aliases such as `Repository Codex`. The name `Necronomicon` is the primary human-facing alias for the Ontology Harness.

## Problem It Solves

Some work is best handled by multiple sigils together. Users should not have to remember the right sequence every time, and individual sigils should not grow extra responsibilities just to support a common workflow.

Spellcraft solves this by creating explicit spell files that compose sigils by reference.

## Use When

- several sigils should run together in a repeatable workflow,
- a repository needs a local spell under `.arcanum/spells/`,
- a user wants to adapt a library spell to local paths and policies,
- outputs from one sigil should become inputs to another,
- a spell needs validation, observability, or revision.

## Do Not Use When

- one sigil already handles the task,
- the composition is a one-off experiment,
- the workflow has no handoff artifacts or gates,
- the spell would copy sigil internals instead of referencing them,
- the user needs immediate execution rather than a reusable local workflow.

## Default Output

Repository-local spells should live at:

```text
.arcanum/spells/<spell-name>.md
```

Reusable library spells live in [spells](../../spells/).

## Alias Rules

- Canonical IDs are stable and use kebab-case.
- Aliases are human-facing names that resolve to canonical IDs.
- Alias lookup is case-insensitive.
- An alias must resolve to exactly one active spell.
- Local repositories may add local aliases without changing upstream spell files.
- Spell run reports should record both the alias used and the canonical ID.

## Why This Is Arcana

Spellcraft coordinates workflow design, local repository adaptation, sigil compatibility checks, gate design, observability, and lifecycle maintenance across multiple sigils.
