# Experiment Harness

Experiment Harness is an Arcana sigil for giving reusable spells and sigils a repeatable development test loop.

It creates an artifact-local `development/` harness, selects realistic prompts, runs bounded Codex CLI examples, saves the real user-facing output, validates expected structure, checks the artifact's Quality Bar and Anti-Patterns, and records timestamped reports.

## Use When

- a new spell or sigil needs promotion evidence,
- a reusable artifact needs low, medium, and complex examples,
- a maintainer wants to run the next missing example output,
- Codex CLI output should be captured as real validation evidence,
- an external repository wants the same testing pattern as Arcanum.

## Do Not Use When

- the task is to design the artifact contract itself,
- the artifact has no reusable behavior to validate,
- the user only wants a one-off manual review,
- live model execution would be unsafe or too expensive without explicit approval.

## Commands

```bash
arcanum/arcana/experiment-harness/scripts/init-harness.sh <artifact-path> --type spell|sigil
arcanum/arcana/experiment-harness/scripts/select-prompt.sh <artifact-path> next
arcanum/arcana/experiment-harness/scripts/run-with-codex.sh <artifact-path> <example-id|next|--all>
arcanum/arcana/experiment-harness/scripts/loop-harness.sh <artifact-path> <regime-id>
arcanum/arcana/experiment-harness/scripts/validate-harness.sh <artifact-path>
arcanum/arcana/experiment-harness/scripts/report-harness.sh <artifact-path>
arcanum/arcana/experiment-harness/scripts/observe-harness.sh <artifact-path> [report-path]
```

Codex command adapters expose the same workflow through:

- `arcanum-sigil-experiment-harness`
- `experiment-next`
- `experiment-run`
- `experiment-validate`
- `experiment-observe`

`experiment-loop` is the live Codex stability loop. It uses regime definitions, repeated attempts, observability, robot-talks improvement reasoning, and rollback on regression. See [development/ARCHITECTURE.md](development/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Closed Loop

The harness closes the development cycle with observability:

1. `run-with-codex.sh` captures real runtime output.
2. `validate-harness.sh` checks fixtures, output shape, and `SKILL.md` `<quality-bar>` / `<anti-patterns>` evidence.
3. `report-harness.sh` writes a timestamped report.
4. `observe-harness.sh` appends one signal-observer-compatible event to `.arcanum/observability/signals/sigil-invocations.jsonl` when the repository observability package exists.
5. Observer hook activity is recorded in `.arcanum/observability/hooks/hook-operations.jsonl`.
6. Reflection counters are updated for later `sigil-development` or `workflow-reflect` review.

Set `EXPERIMENT_OBSERVE=0` when a report should not emit telemetry.

## Quality And Anti-Pattern Checks

The reusable check step reads the target artifact's `SKILL.md` when present:

- `<quality-bar>` criteria are treated as acceptance evidence and map to `pass`, `partial`, `fail`, or `not_checked`.
- `<anti-patterns>` criteria are treated as rejection evidence and surface as `anti_pattern_hits`.
- Empty outputs, save-summary outputs, unresolved placeholders, and contradictory pass-with-blocker language are flagged or blocked.
- Findings are written as machine-readable report lines so `observe-harness.sh` can emit `quality_bar_status`, `anti_pattern_hits`, and `workflow_gaps`.

## Why This Is Arcana

The sigil coordinates lifecycle evidence across artifacts and runtimes. It does not decide what a spell or sigil should mean; it makes the development feedback loop executable and portable.
