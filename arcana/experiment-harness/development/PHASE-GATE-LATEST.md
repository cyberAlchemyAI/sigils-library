# Experiment Harness Phase Gate Latest

- Latest run: `20260518T083859Z`
- Runner: `arcanum/arcana/experiment-harness/development/run-phase-gates.sh`
- Status: `pass`
- Evidence type: deterministic controls and mocked live-loop gates

## Results

| Phase | Status | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 | `pass` | baseline controls, syntax checks, generic validation, and temp observation ran |
| Phase 1 | `pass` | invoke live regime files validate |
| Phase 2 | `pass` | single-attempt loop creates a valid attempt bundle |
| Phase 3 | `pass` | pass streak resets after failure and succeeds after two consecutive passes |
| Phase 4 | `pass` | failed attempt creates robot-talks and improvement argument artifacts |
| Phase 5 | `pass` | patch application and rollback work in an isolated git repo |
| Phase 6 | `pass` | invoke pilot loop passes with mocked live output |
| Phase 7 | `pass` | new harness initialization creates loop-ready layout |

## Lessons Captured

- **Phase 0:** The deterministic baseline can stay green while loop-first features are added behind separate gates.
- **Phase 1:** Explicit prompt paths and required output patterns make regimes both readable and scriptable.
- **Phase 2:** Mocked execution lets us verify bundle shape without spending live Codex calls.
- **Phase 3:** Two consecutive passes catch instability that a two-total-pass rule would miss.
- **Phase 4:** Reflection artifacts can be generated deterministically before richer subagent-based robot-talks exists.
- **Phase 5:** Rollback should be validated in isolation before enabling broad full-artifact edits.
- **Phase 6:** Mocked invoke loops prove harness control flow, but real Codex loops are still required for promotion evidence.
- **Phase 7:** Loop-ready layout can be installed at artifact creation time without running live Codex.

## Remaining Promotion Gap

This latest gate proves the harness mechanics with mocks. It does not replace required live Codex promotion loops for `invoke`.
