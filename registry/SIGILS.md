# Sigil Registry

This registry is the quick-reference index for reusable sigils in Arcanum.

Use it when you know the kind of work you need and want to find the right sigil folder quickly. Each entry summarizes what the sigil does, when to use it, its tier, and where its full instructions live.

## By Tier

### Formulae

- [Observability Setup](../formulae/observability-setup/) - repository-local telemetry package setup for sigil usage.

Formulae are deterministic operational sigils. See [formulae/](../formulae/) for the tier concept.

### Transmutations

- [Context Builder](../transmutations/context-builder/) - compact task-ready context packs from selector-level evidence.
- [Feature Glossary](../transmutations/feature-glossary/) - scoped vocabulary glossary synthesis with source links.
- [Implementation Layering](../transmutations/implementation-layering/) - staged implementation planning from minimum proof to progressive hardening.

Transmutations are bounded cognitive synthesis sigils. See [transmutations/](../transmutations/) for the tier concept.

- [Workflow Reflect](../arcana/workflow-reflect/) - accumulated-signal reflection and improvement proposal generation.

Arcana are autonomous orchestration sigils. See [arcana/](../arcana/) for the tier concept.

## Spells

Spells compose multiple sigils into localized workflows. See [spells/](../spells/) for the concept and [Spell Registry](SPELLS.md) for offered compositions.

## Entry Requirements

A sigil should be added to this registry when it has:

- a dedicated folder under the correct tier,
- a human-facing `README.md`,
- an executable `SKILL.md`,
- a clear Quality Bar,
- clear Anti-Patterns,
- an output contract,
- observability or reflection guidance when the sigil is expected to be reused.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this registry whenever a sigil is added, renamed, retired, moved between tiers, or materially changes its purpose.
