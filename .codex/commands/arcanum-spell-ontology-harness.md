# Arcanum Spell: ontology harness

<!-- arcanum:capability-id ontology-harness -->
<!-- arcanum:capability-kind spell -->
<!-- arcanum:capability-tier spell -->
<!-- arcanum:command arcanum-spell-ontology-harness -->

## Observer Envelope: Task Zero

Before doing domain work, establish the observer envelope for this Arcanum invocation.

- `run_id`: use an existing hook-provided run id when present; otherwise use `arcanum-arcanum-spell-ontology-harness-<UTC timestamp>`.
- `capability.id`: `ontology-harness`
- `capability.kind`: `spell`
- `capability.tier`: `spell`
- `capability.mode`: `command`
- `target_artifact`: this command file
- request summary: summarize the user request before execution.
- expected outputs: list intended artifacts before execution when known.

Closeout is mandatory but must not hide the primary result. At the end, report:

- `OBSERVATION`
- `LEDGER`
- `REFLECTION_TRIGGER`
- `RECOMMENDATION`
- `DEDUPE_KEY`

If deterministic hook or wrapper telemetry is unavailable, preserve the result and report the observability gap.


## Objective

Run the installed Arcanum spell `ontology-harness` using the canonical spell snapshot embedded below.

## Process

1. Use the embedded canonical spell snapshot as the execution contract.
2. Execute only this installed spell unless the definition explicitly delegates or the user asks to route elsewhere.
3. Preserve the selected spell's process, quality bar, output contract, validation gates, gaps, and next route.
4. Return artifact used, command used, validation result, observability result, and next action.

## Guardrails

- Keep this command focused on `ontology-harness`.
- Do not silently add, remove, or refresh capabilities.
- Do not treat generated observer telemetry as a substitute for the primary result.

# Ontology Harness

## Identity

- Canonical ID: `ontology-harness`
- Primary alias: `Ontology Harness`
- Aliases: `Necronomicon Vault`, `Ontology Codex`
- Scope: library

## Purpose

Ontology Harness composes `inventory`, `ontology-vault`, and `context-builder` so a repository can turn vault-like knowledge material into a reusable ontology governance layer.

It is designed for repositories with sessions, discoveries, premises, conventions, confidence rules, or delegated research artifacts that need traceable distillation and promotion gates.

When a repository has both business/domain material and system/runtime material, Ontology Harness can run a branch-aware path that maps business ontology, maps system ontology, and validates the bridge between intent and implementation.

For long-running repository work, use `necronomicon` as the durable operational harness. The session spell keeps memory, selected capability routing, fallback discovery, and capability updates while delegating ontology mapping and bridge validation back to this spell.

## Trigger Conditions

- A repository has a `vault/`, `ontology/`, `discovery/`, `premise/`, `axiom/`, `constitution/`, `sessions/`, or equivalent knowledge-governance area.
- Session records need distillation into durable claims, decisions, contradictions, and open questions.
- Premises or working bets need confidence review.
- Ontology roles, statuses, edge rules, tags, or schema conventions need mapping or update planning.
- Delegated research and synthesis findings need traceability checks.
- Business intent needs explicit links to implementation, tests, telemetry, constraints, or drift findings.

## Required Sigils

| Sigil             | Role In Spell                                                                                | Required Mode                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inventory`       | Install or reuse the compiled knowledge layer and ingest vault sources.                      | `install`, `ingest`, `lookup`, `validate`                                                          |
| `ontology-vault`  | Map, distill, review, promote, propose convention changes, and validate ontology governance. | `map`, `distill-sessions`, `premise-review`, `promote-confidence`, `convention-update`, `validate` |
| `context-builder` | Prove future tasks can retrieve ontology evidence compactly.                                 | dry-run or standard                                                                                |

## Optional Sigils

| Sigil                            | Use When                                                                              | Notes                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `decision-gate`                  | Promotion or convention changes require human trade-off decisions.                    | Use before mutating rules.                                         |
| `feature-glossary`               | Local ontology terms need concise plain-language explanation.                         | Keep glossary explanatory, not authoritative.                      |
| `architecture-pattern-inventory` | System ontology or bridge validation depends on architecture or repository structure. | Recommended for branch-aware mapping with implementation evidence. |

## Prerequisites

- Repository root is known.
- User agrees where local ontology outputs should live.
- Existing vault-like source folders or session records are available, or the user wants an initial ontology map.

- delegated research records found,
- synthesis findings validated,
- premises reviewed,
- promotions recommended,
- convention changes proposed,
- gates passed or blocked,
- handoff artifacts created,
- branch-aware path used,
