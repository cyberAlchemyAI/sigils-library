# Arcanum Sigil: signal observer

<!-- arcanum:capability-kind sigil -->
<!-- arcanum:capability-tier arcana -->
<!-- arcanum:command arcanum-sigil-signal-observer -->

## Observer Envelope: Task Zero

Before doing domain work, establish the observer envelope for this Arcanum invocation.

- `run_id`: use an existing hook-provided run id when present; otherwise use `arcanum-arcanum-sigil-signal-observer-<UTC timestamp>`.
- `capability.id`: `signal-observer`
- `capability.kind`: `sigil`
- `capability.tier`: `arcana`
- `capability.mode`: `command`
- `target_artifact`: this command file
- request summary: summarize the user request before execution.
- expected outputs: list intended artifacts before execution when known.

Closeout is mandatory but must not hide the primary result. At the end, report:

- `OBSERVATION`
- `LEDGER`
- `REFLECTION_TRIGGER`
- `RECOMMENDATION`
- `DEDUPE_KEY`

If deterministic hook or wrapper telemetry is unavailable, preserve the result and report the observability gap.


## Objective

Run the installed Arcanum sigil `signal-observer` using the canonical definition snapshot embedded below.

## Process

1. Use the embedded canonical README and SKILL snapshots as the execution contract.
2. Execute only this installed sigil unless the definition explicitly delegates or the user asks to route elsewhere.
3. Preserve the selected sigil's process, quality bar, anti-patterns, output contract, validation gates, gaps, and next route.
4. Return artifact used, command used, validation result, observability result, and next action.

## Guardrails

- Keep this command focused on `signal-observer`.
- Do not silently add, remove, or refresh capabilities.
- Do not treat generated observer telemetry as a substitute for the primary result.

# Signal Observer

Signal Observer is an Arcana sigil for post-run observation of sigil executions. It reads a completed invocation envelope, derives behavior-level signals, appends telemetry, and recommends whether the sigil needs reflection or targeted maintenance.

It is non-blocking by default. Its job is not to redo the user's task; its job is to make the execution learnable.

## Problem It Solves

Without observation, sigils only improve when someone remembers a problem and manually revisits the workflow. Signal Observer captures lightweight evidence from real use: quality status, anti-pattern hits, workflow gaps, output drift, validation gaps, and reflection triggers.

That evidence lets future maintainers improve sigils from repeated signals rather than isolated impressions.

## Use When

- a sigil run has just completed, blocked, or failed,
- an invocation envelope exists or can be assembled,
- the project uses the repository-local observability package,
- the team wants a durable signal record for future reflection,
- usage patterns should influence sigil maintenance.

## Do Not Use When

- the primary task is still in progress,
- the run produced no meaningful output or decision,
- telemetry would include secrets or sensitive raw content,
- observability write failure would distract from urgent user work,
- a full reflection cycle is already underway.

## Observation Flow

1. Load or assemble the invocation envelope.
2. Validate that required envelope sections exist.
3. Inspect visible execution results, changed artifacts, and validation outcomes.
4. Derive behavior-level signals.
5. Append one JSON object to the configured JSONL ledger.
6. Update reflection counters when configured.
7. Return signal counts and recommended follow-up.

## Output

The sigil emits:

- observed sigil name,
- observation result,
- signal counts by type,
- ledger path,
- reflection trigger state,
- recommended follow-up actions.

## Hook Self-Tracking

Signal Observer may record its own background work only in the hook operations ledger:

```text
.arcanum/observability/hooks/hook-operations.jsonl
```

It must not emit normal capability telemetry for its own hook operation. Hook rows carry `observe: false` so observer activity does not recursively trigger more observation.

## Why This Is Arcana

Signal Observer coordinates evidence interpretation, quality assessment, telemetry mutation, and reflection routing. It is not just a file append; it turns execution traces into governed maintenance signals.

# Sigil: Signal Observer

<objective>
Provide independent post-run observation of sigil executions by reading an invocation envelope, deriving behavior-level signals, appending telemetry, and recommending follow-up.
</objective>

<logic-type>
Arcana: asynchronous observation and reflection routing over execution evidence.
</logic-type>

<applicability>
Use this sigil when:

- a sigil execution has completed, blocked, or failed,
- an invocation envelope exists or can be assembled safely,
- the run produced meaningful user-facing output, decision, validation, or orchestration result,
- the project has or wants a repository-local observability ledger,
- reflection thresholds should be evaluated from real usage.
  </applicability>

<inputs>
Expected inputs:

- invocation envelope path, preferably matching `framework/observability/templates/invocation-envelope.json`,
- optional telemetry ledger path,
- optional hook operations ledger path,
- visible execution summary,
- changed artifact list,
- validation results,
- Quality Bar and Anti-Patterns for the invoked sigil, when available,
- reflection state, when available.
  </inputs>

<default-paths>
Use these defaults when the user does not provide explicit paths:

- envelope: `.arcanum/observability/tmp/latest-invocation.json`
- ledger: `.arcanum/observability/signals/sigil-invocations.jsonl`
- reflection state: `.arcanum/observability/reflection-state.json`
  </default-paths>

<process>
1. Load the invocation envelope.
2. Validate that the envelope contains:
   - timestamp,
   - sigil,
   - tier,
   - mode,
   - request summary or safe raw request,
   - execution status,
   - outputs,
   - changed files,
   - validation entries,
   - observer section or enough evidence to build one.
3. Refuse to store secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, or unnecessary raw content.
4. Derive behavior-level signals:
   - `quality-pass`: Quality Bar appears satisfied,
   - `quality-gap`: Quality Bar is partial, failed, or unchecked without reason,
   - `anti-pattern-hit`: observed workflow violated an Anti-Pattern,
   - `output-drift`: output differs from the sigil output contract,
   - `workflow-gap`: trigger, input, process, template, validation, observability, or reflection gap,
   - `rework`: failure, correction, and pass sequence is visible,
   - `useful-pattern`: repeated behavior appears worth preserving.
5. Set reflection trigger state:
   - `none`,
   - `manual`,
   - `usage-threshold`,
   - `output-threshold`,
   - `gap-threshold`,
   - `severe-gap`.
6. Append exactly one JSON object to the configured JSONL ledger.
7. Record observer hook activity in the hook operations ledger with `observe: false` when hook self-tracking is enabled.
8. Update reflection counters if reflection state is available.
9. Validate appended telemetry when a JSON or JSONL checker is available.
10. Return a concise observation report.
</process>

<authority-rule>
This sigil is non-blocking by default. It appends observability signals and updates reflection counters only. It must not modify application source code, user artifacts, or the observed sigil unless explicitly delegated by a separate maintenance workflow.
</authority-rule>

<loop-guard>
Signal Observer must not observe its own hook operation as a normal capability run.

Use `.arcanum/observability/hooks/hook-operations.jsonl` for observer start, completion, skip, failure, and dedupe events. These rows must carry `observe: false`.
</loop-guard>

<privacy-rules>
- Do not store secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, or sensitive raw content.
- Prefer summaries over raw request text when the request contains private details.
- Prefer file paths and artifact names over large content excerpts.
- Mark missing evidence as `not_checked` rather than inferring success.
</privacy-rules>

<quality-bar>
A successful execution of this sigil must:

- read or assemble a valid invocation envelope,
- derive signals only from visible evidence,
- append one valid JSON object per observed invocation,
- preserve privacy and avoid sensitive raw content,
- classify Quality Bar status and Anti-Pattern hits when evidence exists,
- evaluate reflection trigger state,
- avoid blocking or changing the primary task outcome.
  </quality-bar>

<anti-patterns>
Avoid:

- rewriting the observed sigil during observation,
- storing secrets or large raw conversation excerpts,
- inventing quality status without evidence,
- appending invalid JSONL,
- treating observability failure as primary task failure unless observability was the requested task,
- producing many telemetry rows for one invocation,
- hiding severe workflow gaps behind a generic success note.
  </anti-patterns>

<output-contract>
Return:

```markdown
## Signal Observer Result

- Observed sigil: <name>
- Result: recorded | skipped | failed
- Ledger: <path>
- Signals: <counts by type>
