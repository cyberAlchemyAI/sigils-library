# Sigil: Decision Gate

<objective>
Resolve every blocker-level multi-option decision before consequential work proceeds, and persist a reusable decision record.
</objective>

<logic-type>
Arcana: decision governance with human gatekeeping and pass/block authority.
</logic-type>

<applicability>
Use this sigil when:

- a task has multiple viable options,
- the choice affects future scope, implementation, documentation, rollout, policy, verification, cost, or risk,
- the agent cannot responsibly infer the correct option,
- downstream work should stop until the decision is explicit,
- a durable decision record is needed.
</applicability>

<inputs>
Expected inputs, if available:

- target scope or task name,
- existing request, plan, notes, requirements, architecture docs, or implementation files,
- known constraints,
- options already proposed by the user,
- preferred output path,
- decision profile, if the project has one.
</inputs>

<default-output>
If the user does not provide `--output`, write or update the decision record at the first suitable location:

1. `docs/decisions/{target-scope}.md` when a docs folder exists,
2. `decisions/{target-scope}.md` when a decisions folder exists,
3. `DECISIONS.md` at the repository root when no better location exists.
</default-output>

<process>
1. Identify the target scope and the consequential work that is blocked by unresolved decisions.
2. Gather only relevant context: user request, current plan, requirements, architecture notes, related docs, implementation files, tests, and known constraints.
3. Enumerate unresolved decisions with more than one viable option.
4. Classify each decision:
   - blocker: must be resolved before consequential mutation,
   - deferrable: can be recorded and revisited later,
   - assumption: can proceed if clearly labeled.
5. For each blocker decision, prepare concrete options with concise trade-offs:
   - option name,
   - benefit,
   - cost or risk,
   - when to choose it,
   - downstream impact.
6. Ask the user each blocker decision:
   - prefer an ask-questions interface when available,
   - otherwise use plain conversation with numbered options.
7. Continue until all blocker decisions are resolved or the user explicitly defers/stops.
8. If any blocker decision remains unresolved, return `BLOCK` and do not proceed with consequential mutation.
9. Persist the decision record with:
   - decision question,
   - considered options,
   - selected option,
   - rationale,
   - source of decision,
   - timestamp,
   - remaining blockers,
   - deferred decisions or assumptions.
10. Return a decision-gate summary with `PASS` or `BLOCK`, resolved decisions, remaining blockers, and the decision artifact path.
</process>

<authority-rule>
When this sigil returns `BLOCK`, consequential mutation should not proceed until the blocker decisions are resolved or the user explicitly overrides the gate.
</authority-rule>

<observability>
For reusable use, emit a post-run invocation signal using the repository-local observability package when available.

Recommended signals:

- decision count,
- blocker count,
- unresolved blocker count,
- pass/block result,
- output path,
- user override, if any,
- follow-up reflection trigger when the same decision type repeats.
</observability>

<quality-bar>
A successful execution of this sigil must:

- identify every visible blocker-level multi-option decision,
- separate blocker decisions from deferrable decisions and assumptions,
- present options with meaningful trade-offs,
- avoid choosing on the user's behalf when the decision is consequential,
- persist a reviewable decision record,
- return a clear `PASS` or `BLOCK` result,
- preserve enough context for future reviewers to understand why each decision was made.
</quality-bar>

<anti-patterns>
Avoid:

- asking the user to decide trivial or fully reversible details,
- bundling multiple independent decisions into one vague question,
- presenting options without trade-offs,
- treating silence as consent for a blocker decision,
- proceeding with consequential mutation after a `BLOCK` result,
- hiding assumptions inside implementation or documentation,
- writing a decision record that cannot be traced back to the user choice or source context.
</anti-patterns>

<output-contract>
