# Invoke Validation Experiment

This experiment applies the framework [Validation Experiment Protocol](../../../framework/VALIDATION-EXPERIMENT-PROTOCOL.md) to the `invoke` spell.

## Artifact

- Canonical ID: `invoke`
- Source path: [../README.md](../README.md)
- Promotion target: library spell registry release after L1 validation
- Current status: L0 `define` implemented, L1 `design` contract implemented, L2/L3 modes deferred

## Hypothesis

`invoke` can reliably turn vague development intent into governed define outputs, then turn approved define outputs into a governed design bundle with six required views, glossary consistency checks, explicit gaps, non-mutating upstream behavior, and transport-ready handoff reports.

If this passes, `invoke` is ready to proceed to L2 planning work. If it fails, planning/full/validate work remains blocked.

## Fixtures

| Fixture ID | Scenario | Input Shape | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [TEMPLATE-TASK-MATRIX](TEMPLATE-VALIDATION-TASKS.md) | Template validation task inventory. | Every invoke-owned template family or standalone companion. | `pass`; each template target has low, medium, and complex realistic tasks. |
| [INV-DEFINE-PASS-001](fixtures/INV-DEFINE-PASS-001.md) | Define from vague but usable development intent. | Core goal, scope hints, template inventory, concept sources. | `pass`; spec, glossary, and define transport outputs are produced. |
| [INV-DEFINE-BLOCK-001](fixtures/INV-DEFINE-BLOCK-001.md) | Missing core goal. | No actionable goal or scope boundary. | `block`; result records missing goal and keeps next route deferred. |
| [INV-DEFINE-FLAG-001](fixtures/INV-DEFINE-FLAG-001.md) | No exact eligible template and candidate creation is unapproved. | Core goal with unsupported template fit. | `flag`; candidate-template gap is recorded without promotion. |
| [INV-DEFINE-GLOSSARY-001](fixtures/INV-DEFINE-GLOSSARY-001.md) | New glossary term has no Necronomicon match. | Core goal with a local term, `sol-thread`. | `pass`; no-match term is recorded with rationale and promotion gate. |
| [INV-DESIGN-PASS-001](fixtures/INV-DESIGN-PASS-001.md) | Design from approved define outputs. | Approved spec, approved glossary, source contracts, design constraints. | `pass`; architecture bundle includes all six views, glossary consistency report, design transport report, and next route `plan`. |
| [INV-DESIGN-BLOCK-001](fixtures/INV-DESIGN-BLOCK-001.md) | Missing source contracts without discovery approval. | User asks for design, but approved source contracts are absent and discovery mode is not approved. | `block`; result records missing inputs and routes back to `define` or discovery approval. |
| [INV-DESIGN-FLAG-001](fixtures/INV-DESIGN-FLAG-001.md) | Evidence ambiguity. | Approved spec exists, but architecture evidence is contradictory or incomplete. | `flag` or `block` depending on decision impact; research companion is selected and claim status is carried into design decisions. |
| [INV-DESIGN-HANDOFF-001](fixtures/INV-DESIGN-HANDOFF-001.md) | Spell or sigil target. | Approved define outputs target a spell or sigil. | `pass` or `flag`; `invoke` emits handoff context and routes execution to `spellcraft` or `sigil-development`. |
| [INV-INTEGRATION-DEFINE-DESIGN-001](fixtures/INV-INTEGRATION-DEFINE-DESIGN-001.md) | Define-to-design integration chain. | Realistic request, define expected output, concrete spec/glossary/transport artifacts, and design expected output. | `pass`; design consumes define artifacts, preserves glossary terms, emits six views, records transport, and routes to `plan`. |

## Execution Method

Use the contract dry-run runner:

```bash
arcanum/spells/invoke/development/run-validation-fixtures.sh
```

The runner does not invoke a live Codex command process. It replays fixture expectations against the canonical `invoke define` and `invoke design` contract gates. This keeps the experiment reproducible until a live Codex command execution harness exists.

Each fixture also includes a realistic user request and an expected user-facing `Invoke Validation Fixture Result` file. The runner checks both the fixture and expected output.

Each run writes a timestamped report under `arcanum/spells/invoke/development/runs/`.

To run every template task through Codex, generate prompts with [generate-template-example-prompts.sh](generate-template-example-prompts.sh) and follow [TEMPLATE-EXAMPLE-RUNBOOK.md](TEMPLATE-EXAMPLE-RUNBOOK.md).

## Required Checks

| Check | Command Or Method | Pass Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Markdown links | `find arcanum/spells/invoke -name '*.md' -print0 \| xargs -0 -n1 ./tools/check_markdown_links.sh` | Every invoke markdown file reports passing links. |
| Spell contract structure | Review against [../../../arcana/spellcraft/SKILL.md](../../../arcana/spellcraft/SKILL.md) validate criteria. | Identity, modes, phases, gates, handoffs, failure policy, observability, and output contract are present. |
| Template scaffold coverage | Inspect [../templates/README.md](../templates/README.md) and family folders. | Required family README, primary template, passing example, and missing-input example exist. |
| Template task matrix coverage | Inspect [TEMPLATE-VALIDATION-TASKS.md](TEMPLATE-VALIDATION-TASKS.md). | Module Formulae, standalone companions, and each dedicated family have low, medium, and complex tasks. |
| Template prompt coverage | Inspect `example-prompts/`. | Every template task has a generated Codex invocation prompt and output capture path. |
| Prompt selector coverage | Run [select-template-example-prompt.sh](select-template-example-prompt.sh). | Exact task ID, template+complexity, and `next` selection return prompt and output paths. |
| Define gate coverage | Review [../define.md](../define.md). | Missing goal blocks, candidate-template gaps flag, glossary promotion is gated, and define transport behavior is defined. |
| Design gate coverage | Review [../design.md](../design.md). | Six views, glossary consistency, source-contract gate, no-silent-upstream-mutation, and transport behavior are defined. |
| Codex adapter readiness | Inspect `.arcanum/runtimes/codex/commands/arcanum-spell-invoke.md` and `.codex/commands/arcanum-spell-invoke.md`. | Codex can discover `arcanum-spell-invoke`, and the adapter routes to canonical `arcanum/spells/invoke` contracts. |
| Fixture replay | `arcanum/spells/invoke/development/run-validation-fixtures.sh` | Every fixture and expected output reports `PASS`, the final result is `RESULT: pass`, and a timestamped run report is written. |
| Integration replay | `arcanum/spells/invoke/development/run-validation-fixtures.sh` | Define-to-design fixture proves spec, glossary, and transport artifacts feed the design output. |
| Registry gate | Inspect [../../../registry/SPELLS.md](../../../registry/SPELLS.md). | `invoke` is not registered until validation passes. |

## Dry-Run Output Contract

Each fixture dry-run should return:

```markdown
## Invoke Validation Fixture Result

- Fixture: <fixture-id>
- Mode: define | design
- Phase status: pass | flag | block
- Inputs present: <summary>
- Template/profile selection: <summary>
- Design views: <coverage summary | n/a>
- Glossary consistency: pass | flag | block | n/a
- Transport report: <path | simulated>
- Decisions: <summary>
- Unresolved gaps: <summary>
- Expected next route: plan | define | spellcraft | sigil-development | deferred
- Verdict: pass | flag | block
```

## Promotion Gates

`invoke` may move from L1 contract to L2 planning work when:

- `TEMPLATE-TASK-MATRIX` passes,
- `PROMPT-SELECTOR` passes,
- `INV-DEFINE-PASS-001` passes,
- `INV-DEFINE-BLOCK-001` blocks for the expected reason,
- `INV-DEFINE-FLAG-001` flags for the expected candidate-template reason,
- `INV-DEFINE-GLOSSARY-001` records a no-match glossary term without silent promotion,
- `INV-DESIGN-PASS-001` passes,
- `INV-DESIGN-BLOCK-001` blocks for the expected reason,
- `INV-INTEGRATION-DEFINE-DESIGN-001` passes,
- companion selection works for research, UX, spell, and sigil design cases,
- glossary conflicts are recorded instead of silently promoted,
- Codex adapter files exist and point to canonical `invoke` contracts,
- validation findings are recorded in a follow-up `VALIDATION.md` report.

Registry release remains blocked until L2/L3 plan, full, validate, examples, and registry gates pass.

## Current Initial Verdict

`pass`.

The contract and template scaffolds are present, markdown links pass, Codex adapter files exist, and the L0 define plus L1 design dry-run fixtures are recorded in [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md).

## Next Actions

1. Use the Codex command bridge at `.codex/commands/arcanum-spell-invoke.md` for local Codex invocation.
2. Promote to L2 planning work.
3. Keep registry release blocked until L2/L3 validation passes.
