- Latest deterministic control report: generated under ignored `runs/`

## Checks Performed

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Markdown links | pass | `find arcanum/spells/invoke -name '*.md' -print0 \| xargs -0 -n1 ./tools/check_markdown_links.sh` passed for all invoke markdown files. |
| Spell contract structure | pass | [../README.md](../README.md), [../define.md](../define.md), and [../design.md](../design.md) define identity, modes, phases, gates, handoffs, failure policy, observability, and output contracts. |
| Template scaffold coverage | pass | [../templates/README.md](../templates/README.md) declares family scaffold requirements; `generic`, `research`, `architecture`, `implementation-plan`, `spell`, `sigil`, and `ux-plan` folders include README, primary template, passing example, and missing-input example. |
| Template task matrix coverage | pass | [TEMPLATE-VALIDATION-TASKS.md](TEMPLATE-VALIDATION-TASKS.md) lists low, medium, and complex tasks for Module Formulae, standalone companions, and each dedicated family. |
| Template prompt coverage | pass | [TEMPLATE-EXAMPLE-RUNBOOK.md](TEMPLATE-EXAMPLE-RUNBOOK.md) explains how to run every generated prompt in Codex; `example-prompts/` contains one prompt per template task. |
| Prompt selector coverage | pass | [select-template-example-prompt.sh](select-template-example-prompt.sh) resolves exact task IDs, template+complexity pairs, and `next`; Codex command bridges exist for `arcanum-sigil-invoke-example-runner`; [run-template-example-with-codex.sh](run-template-example-with-codex.sh) provides bounded `codex exec` automation. |
| Example output coverage | pass | Saved example outputs under `example-outputs/` are checked for real `Invoke Result` shape and rejected if they are save-summary responses; architecture outputs must include a full architecture artifact with all required sections. |
| Define gate coverage | pass | [../define.md](../define.md) blocks missing core goals, flags unapproved candidate-template cases, gates glossary promotion, and defines transport behavior. |
| Design gate coverage | pass | [../design.md](../design.md) requires six views, source-contract gating, glossary consistency, non-mutating upstream behavior, and design transport. |
| Registry gate | pass | [../../../registry/SPELLS.md](../../../registry/SPELLS.md) does not yet register `invoke`; release remains blocked until validation passes. |
| Codex adapter readiness | pass | Root-level `.arcanum/runtimes/codex/commands/arcanum-spell-invoke.md` and `.codex/commands/arcanum-spell-invoke.md` exist and route Codex to canonical `arcanum/spells/invoke` contracts. |
| Fixture replay | pass | `arcanum/spells/invoke/development/run-validation-fixtures.sh` reports all define and design realistic fixtures and expected output files passing. |
| Integration replay | pass | `INV-INTEGRATION-DEFINE-DESIGN-001` proves define artifacts feed design inputs, preserve glossary terms, emit six views, and route next to `plan`. |
| Live define loop | pass | [live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-001/loop-report.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-001/loop-report.md) reached two consecutive passing Codex attempts; [output.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-001/output.md) preserves the real artifact body. |
| Live design loop | pass | [live-evidence/LIVE-DESIGN-001/loop-report.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DESIGN-001/loop-report.md) reached two consecutive passing Codex attempts after correcting overly broad placeholder/blocker detection in the harness validator; [output.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DESIGN-001/output.md) preserves the real artifact body. |
| Live define-to-design loop | pass | [live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-DESIGN-001/loop-report.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-DESIGN-001/loop-report.md) reached two consecutive passing Codex attempts and preserved the define-to-design authority boundary; [output.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-DESIGN-001/output.md) preserves the real artifact body. |
| Observability loop | pass | `.arcanum/observability/signals/sigil-invocations.jsonl` records completed observer telemetry with `quality_bar_status`, `anti_pattern_hits`, `workflow_gaps`, and `reflection_trigger`; hook rows in `.arcanum/observability/hooks/hook-operations.jsonl` carry `observe: false` and duplicate observer emission skips cleanly. |

## Loop Validation

Live Codex loop validation is now required promotion evidence for the implemented `invoke` scope. Deterministic fixtures remain controls; they prove stable contract expectations, but they do not replace live execution.

| Regime | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CTRL-DEFINE-001` | pass | `run-validation-fixtures.sh` latest generated report under ignored `runs/` |
| `CTRL-DESIGN-001` | pass | `run-validation-fixtures.sh` latest generated report under ignored `runs/` |
| `CTRL-INTEGRATION-001` | pass | `run-validation-fixtures.sh` latest generated report under ignored `runs/` |
| `CTRL-CONTRACT-001` | pass | `run-validation-fixtures.sh` latest generated report under ignored `runs/` |
| `LIVE-DEFINE-001` | pass | [live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-001/loop-report.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-001/loop-report.md), [output.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-001/output.md), [validation.json](live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-001/validation.json) |
| `LIVE-DESIGN-001` | pass | [live-evidence/LIVE-DESIGN-001/loop-report.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DESIGN-001/loop-report.md), [output.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DESIGN-001/output.md), [validation.json](live-evidence/LIVE-DESIGN-001/validation.json) |
| `LIVE-DEFINE-DESIGN-001` | pass | [live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-DESIGN-001/loop-report.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-DESIGN-001/loop-report.md), [output.md](live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-DESIGN-001/output.md), [validation.json](live-evidence/LIVE-DEFINE-DESIGN-001/validation.json) |
| `LIVE-OBSERVABILITY-001` | pass | Observer emissions recorded for define, design, and define-to-design loop reports with observer version `0.1.1`; duplicate design observation skipped by dedupe. |

Latest live loop machine summaries:

```text
LIVE-DEFINE-001: VALIDATION=pass QUALITY_BAR_STATUS=pass ANTI_PATTERN_HITS_JSON=[] WORKFLOW_GAPS_JSON=[]
LIVE-DESIGN-001: VALIDATION=pass QUALITY_BAR_STATUS=pass ANTI_PATTERN_HITS_JSON=[] WORKFLOW_GAPS_JSON=[]
LIVE-DEFINE-DESIGN-001: VALIDATION=pass QUALITY_BAR_STATUS=pass ANTI_PATTERN_HITS_JSON=[] WORKFLOW_GAPS_JSON=[]
```

Failure/improvement evidence: an earlier generated `LIVE-DESIGN-001` partial loop produced non-pass attempts with `robot-talks.md` and `improvement-argument.md` artifacts. That loop exposed overly broad harness checks for Mermaid decision braces and benign missing-field decision rules; after tightening the validator, the design regime passed with two consecutive live attempts.

Registry release remains blocked for `plan`, `full`, and `validate` modes until they have matching deterministic controls and live loop regimes.

## Fixture Status

| Fixture ID | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [TEMPLATE-TASK-MATRIX](TEMPLATE-VALIDATION-TASKS.md) | pass | Template task inventory covers low, medium, and complex tasks for every invoke-owned template family or standalone companion. |
| PROMPT-SELECTOR | pass | Prompt selector and Codex command bridge can choose a prompt by task ID, template+complexity, or next unrun prompt. |
| EXAMPLE-OUTPUTS | pass | Existing Codex-generated example outputs have real result bodies, including `Mode` and `Phase status`. |
| [INV-DEFINE-PASS-001](fixtures/INV-DEFINE-PASS-001.md) | pass | Define dry-run from vague but usable Mars rover maintenance request produces spec, glossary, define transport, and layering seed evidence. |
| [INV-DEFINE-BLOCK-001](fixtures/INV-DEFINE-BLOCK-001.md) | pass | Define dry-run with missing core goal blocks at the expected gate and records missing goal and scope boundary. |
| [INV-DEFINE-FLAG-001](fixtures/INV-DEFINE-FLAG-001.md) | pass | Define dry-run with unsupported template fit flags candidate-template approval gap without promotion. |
| [INV-DEFINE-GLOSSARY-001](fixtures/INV-DEFINE-GLOSSARY-001.md) | pass | Define dry-run records `sol-thread` as a no-match glossary term with rationale and promotion gate. |
| [INV-DESIGN-PASS-001](fixtures/INV-DESIGN-PASS-001.md) | pass | Dry-run from approved spec, glossary, source contracts, and design constraints selects the Module Formulae architecture profile, requires all six views, emits glossary consistency and design transport outputs, and routes next to `plan`. |
| [INV-DESIGN-BLOCK-001](fixtures/INV-DESIGN-BLOCK-001.md) | pass | Dry-run with missing source contracts and no discovery approval blocks at the normal design activation gate and routes to `define` or explicit discovery-mode approval. |
| [INV-DESIGN-FLAG-001](fixtures/INV-DESIGN-FLAG-001.md) | pass | Dry-run with contradictory evidence selects the `research` companion, carries claim status into design decisions, and flags unless the ambiguity affects a required design decision, in which case it blocks. |
| [INV-DESIGN-HANDOFF-001](fixtures/INV-DESIGN-HANDOFF-001.md) | pass | Dry-run for spell and sigil targets emits handoff context only, routes lifecycle execution to `spellcraft` or `sigil-development`, and does not take lifecycle ownership. |
| [INV-INTEGRATION-DEFINE-DESIGN-001](fixtures/INV-INTEGRATION-DEFINE-DESIGN-001.md) | pass | Integration dry-run chains define output artifacts into design inputs and verifies glossary preservation, six-view design output, transport, and next route `plan`. |

## Findings

1. The contract layer is coherent enough to run validation fixtures.
2. The template inventory is structurally complete for the declared candidate families.
3. Codex can discover `invoke` through the root-level `.codex/commands/arcanum-spell-invoke.md` bridge.
4. L1 design fixtures produce recorded dry-run evidence and pass.
5. The define-to-design integration fixture proves cross-stage handoff at the artifact level.

## Decision

Promote `invoke` from L1 validation to L2 planning work.

Do not register `invoke` in the spell registry yet. Registry release still requires `plan`, `full`, `validate`, examples, deterministic controls, live loop regimes, and release validation.

## Next Actions

1. Implement the L2 `plan` contract.
2. Extend Codex dry-run validation to `plan` low-complexity, `plan` medium/high-complexity, and blocked planning gates.
3. Keep registry release blocked until `full` and `validate` mode evidence exists.
