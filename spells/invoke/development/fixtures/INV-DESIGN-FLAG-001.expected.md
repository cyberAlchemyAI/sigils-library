## Invoke Validation Fixture Result

- Fixture: INV-DESIGN-FLAG-001
- User request: Design a research evidence ingestion architecture where two source notes disagree about whether ingestion should be append-only or allow correction.
- Mode: design
- Spell: invoke
- Canonical ID: invoke
- Scope: library
- Phase status: flag
- Mode contract: arcanum/spells/invoke/design.md
- Outputs: artifacts/evidence-ingestion/ARCHITECTURE.md, artifacts/evidence-ingestion/research-brief.md, artifacts/evidence-ingestion/glossary-consistency.md, .arcanum/necronomicon/sessions/demo/invoke-transports/design.md
- Design views: context, high-level structure, low-level components, workflow process, decision flow, dependency interface
- Glossary consistency: pass
- Template/profile selection: Module Formulae architecture profile plus research companion
- Implementation layering: seed emitted
- Work-pack: n/a
- Decisions: isolate correction policy behind an explicit decision point; carry claim status into architecture decisions
- Unresolved gaps: ingestion correction policy needs decision-gate before implementation planning
- Next route: deferred
