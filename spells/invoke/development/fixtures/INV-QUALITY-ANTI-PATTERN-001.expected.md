## Expected Classifications

```text
QUALITY_BAR_STATUS=pass
QUALITY_BAR_STATUS=partial
QUALITY_BAR_STATUS=fail
ANTI_PATTERN_HITS_JSON=["save-summary output instead of artifact body","design proceeds without approved define outputs","deferred plan/full behavior emitted from design"]
WORKFLOW_GAPS_JSON=[{"category":"quality-bar","severity":"medium","summary":"usable output has unresolved non-blocker gaps","evidence":"fixture"},{"category":"anti-pattern","severity":"severe","summary":"design treats missing contracts as approved","evidence":"fixture"}]
