# Invoke Template Validation Tasks

This matrix defines realistic low, medium, and complex validation tasks for every invoke-owned template family or standalone companion.

These are not promotion examples by themselves. They are the task inventory used to decide which template fixtures must exist before a template family can be considered broadly validated.

## Complexity Scale

| Complexity | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| low | One bounded artifact, few actors, no cross-stage ambiguity. |
| medium | Several artifacts or actors, real decisions, some handoff risk. |
| complex | Multi-stage, cross-domain, high ambiguity, or multiple ownership boundaries. |

## Fixture Requirements

Each task family should eventually have:

- one low-complexity fixture,
- one medium-complexity fixture,
- one complex fixture,
- one expected user-facing output for each fixture,
- at least one negative fixture for missing inputs or unsupported routing,
- runner coverage that checks the expected output shape.

## Current Coverage Use

This matrix is the template coverage backlog. The validation runner checks that every declared template has low, medium, and complex task IDs. Dedicated executable fixtures can then be added in waves without losing the complete coverage map.
