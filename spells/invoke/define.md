# Invoke Define Mode

## Identity

- Spell: `invoke`
- Mode: `define`
- Status: implemented (L0 contract, candidate template-family scaffold coverage)

## Purpose

Define mode produces or updates a governed specification and glossary baseline with explicit decisions, evidence-aware template routing, and transport-ready handoff artifacts.

## Implementation Coverage

- The define contract, Module Formulae baseline templates, standalone implementation-layering/work-pack templates, and dedicated candidate family scaffolds are implemented.
- Named template families are scaffolded as candidate templates; canonical promotion still requires validation evidence and explicit approval.
- Implementation layering is integrated as a companion artifact policy: define may seed L0 or record a layering gap for downstream plan/full modes.
- Registry release remains blocked until required template and profile-family validation examples pass.

## Inputs

- user goal and scope hints
- existing artifacts and local constraints
- template inventory or candidate-template permission
- optional existing implementation-layering artifact for update or reuse
- glossary sources from Necronomicon context when needed

## Mode Gates

- Template selection must include eligibility evidence and explicit user choice on tie cases.
- Current prebuilt template coverage includes Module Formulae, standalone implementation-layering/work-pack companions, and dedicated candidate family scaffolds; any unsupported new family must be reported as a candidate-template gap, not treated as implemented coverage.
- Define mode may emit an implementation-layering seed; if skipped, it must record an explicit layering gap for downstream `plan`, `full`, and `validate` modes.
- Glossary linking uses deterministic statuses: `linked`, `partial`, or `no-match` with rationale.
- Candidate glossary promotion is never automatic.
- No silent upstream mutation; direct upstream edits require explicit approval.
- Define-stage transport appends stage reports and complements matching Necronomicon sections only when they already exist.

## Handoff Artifacts

- define context summary
- spec artifact path
- glossary artifact path
- implementation layering artifact path or explicit layering gap
- template selection evidence
- unresolved gaps and blocker decisions
- Necronomicon transport report
- recommended next route (`spellcraft`, `sigil-development`, or deferred follow-up)
